# stm32-data

`stm32-data` is a project aiming to produce clean machine-readable data about the STM32 microcontroller
families, including:

- :heavy_check_mark: Base chip information
    - RAM, flash
    - Packages
- :heavy_check_mark: Peripheral addresses and interrupts
- :heavy_check_mark: Interrupts
- :heavy_check_mark: GPIO AlternateFunction mappings (for all families except F1)
- :x: GPIO mappings for F1
- :construction: Register blocks for all peripherals
- :heavy_check_mark: DMA stream mappings
- :x: Per-package pinouts
- :heavy_check_mark: Links to applicable reference manuals, datasheets, appnotes PDFs.

:heavy_check_mark: = done, :construction: = work in progress, :x: = to do

## Data sources

These are the data sources currently used.

- STM32Cube database: describes all MCUs, with useful stuff like GPIO AF mappings, DMA stream mappings, pinouts...
- stm32-rs SVDs: register blocks. YAMLs are extracted and manually cleaned up.

## Install pre-requisites

In order to run the generator, you will need to install the following tools:

* `wget`
* `git`
* `jq`
* `svd` â€“ `pip3 install svdtools` 

## Generating the YAMLs

- Run `./d download-all`
- Run `python3 parse.py`

This generates all the YAMLs in `data/` except those in `data/registers/`, which are manually extracted and cleaned up.

## Extracting new register blocks

For instance, to add support for the G0 series first download all the source
SVDs:
```
$ ./d download-all
```
Now extract the RCC peripheral registers:
```
./d install-chiptool
./d extract-all RCC --transform ./transform-RCC.yaml
```
Note that we have used a transform to mechanically clean up some of the RCC
definitions. This will produce a YAML file for each chip model in `./tmp/RCC`
At this point we need to choose the model with the largest peripheral set (e.g.
the STM32G081) and compare its YAML against each of the other models' to verify
that they are all mutually consistent.

Finally, we can merge
```
./merge_regs.py tmp/RCC/g0*.yaml
```
This will produce `regs_merged.yaml`, which we can copy into its final resting
place:
```
mv regs_merged.yaml data/registers/rcc_g0.yaml
```
